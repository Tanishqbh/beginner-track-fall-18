    "## What you'll learn\n",
    "### Code\n",
    "General coding constructs like loops, conditionals, functions etc. We'll also go over concepts used extensively in Machine Learning and the rest of our series: Vectors and manipulating Vectors through code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Math\n",
    "Linear Algebra concepts like Matrix Multiplication, vector addition, dot products, etc. We'll be going over concepts from Multivariable Calculus like gradients and partial derivatives, but we'll also give you the Single Variable Calculus equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's get into it!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do we code?\n",
    "Humans are generally smarter than computers (for now), but machines can perform some types of functions quickly and repeatedly. The sheer speed of computers is what makes them indipensible. To make computers use that speed in ways we want them to, we code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quick notes** before we get to the code examples:\n",
    "* We use the print() function to output things. If you're unsure what this means, don't worry about it - take it as a black box and just know you can use the print() function to output things in later exercises.\n",
    "*  Indentation matters in python. Keep indentation consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So what are some things a computer can do?\n",
    "A computer can **store data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We store \"singular\" data by using **variables**. In Python, you do not have to specify the type of variable upon creation. However, it is still useful to know the most common data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numbers**\n",
    "   *   **int:** integer.\n",
    "   *   **double / float:** numbers with decimal places.\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Strings / chars**\n",
    "   *   **character (char for short):** a single character, ex. 'a', '1' - we usually put chars in single quotes.\n",
    "   *   **string:** a sequence of characters. We usually put strings in double or single quotes, ex. \"Artificial intelligence probably won't end the world\", 'Andrew Ng is cool.'\n",
    "   *  Note: Strings and chars have lots of useful functions that are good to know. We won't spend time on them here, though.\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Boolean:** has value of true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to know basic **math operations** available to you. Below are the five most important ones, with code examples below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Addition: +**\n"
